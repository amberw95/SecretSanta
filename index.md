title: What is this secret santa picker?
---
This is a secret santa picker, that will help a single person organize and participate in a secret santa gift exchange without knowing the assignments. Each individual will be privately emailed their assignment.

## How are we different?
We do not store any information. All emails are ephemeral and only known during the runtime of the application. We do not have ads. We also support anti-affinity assignments for secret santa exchanges.

## What is anti-affinity?
A member of a group cannot receive or give a gift to another member in their group.

For example, if we have four couples exchanging gifts. You would create four groups, each containing the couples. This will ensure those couples will not be assigned to one another.

For an exchange of six individuals, you would create 6 groups each with one member.

## Example Email

Hi \<NAME-1>,

\<ADMIN-NAME> invites you to join the \<TITLE> Secret Santa on \<DATE>. The spending limit is \<SPENDING-AMOUNT>.
Your secret santa assignment is \<NAME-2>.

Merry Christmas!!
